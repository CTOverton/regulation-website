                our regular RSS feed and YouTube channel so, for our first
                episode, we're going to use our brand new Patreon for hosting.
                You can use our Patreon RSS this week to listen to our first
                episode at 10PM CT TONIGHT! That's right, because of the
                technical hurdles we're putting everyone through, and because
                we're kind of too excited to wait anyway, we're releasing our
                first episode of Regulation Podcast tonight at 10pm CT. If you
                prefer to get it on youtube, you can. We'll be posting it to our
                Regulation Podcast Gaming Channel which is right here:
                https://www.youtube.com/@TheRegulationPodcast`
